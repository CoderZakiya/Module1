                <h2>Magpie</h2>
                <p>
                    The Oriental magpie-robin (locally known as Doel) is the national bird of Bangladesh. Scientifically
                    called Copsychus
                    saularis, this small, lively bird is admired for its striking black-and-white plumage and its
                    melodious song. It is
                    commonly found in gardens, forests, and rural areas across the country, where its sweet whistling
                    notes are especially
                    heard at dawn and dusk. The magpie-robin symbolizes beauty, grace, and the rich natural heritage of
                    Bangladesh, and it
                    is deeply embedded in the nation’s culture, literature, and art.

                    The Oriental magpie-robin is also featured in public monuments and cultural representations
                    throughout Bangladesh. A
                    well-known sculpture of the Doel stands in the capital city, Dhaka, reflecting its importance as a
                    national symbol.
                    Because of its friendly nature and beautiful voice, it remains one of the most beloved birds among
                    the people of
                    Bangladesh.
